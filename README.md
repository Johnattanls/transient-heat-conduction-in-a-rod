Transient heat conduction in a rod

This project deals with the analysis of a heat flow in two dimensions (2D) in a square bar of different materials, which was used to perform computational programming approach that befits finite differences. Through mathematical proofs will be introduced relations used as parameters for programming and provided different behavioral graphs of the material analyzed. The graphics will be discussed for a better understanding of the reader. At the end there are some considerations regarding the results and their significance in understanding the discipline of heat transfer.
